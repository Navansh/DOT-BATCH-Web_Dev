What is difference between MongoDB and Node.js ? 
Ans : MongoDB and Node.js are two different technologies that can be used together to build web applications, but they serve different purposes. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format. It is designed to work well with unstructured data and provides features such as automatic sharding and replication for high availability and scalability. Node.js, on the other hand, is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is often used for building server-side applications, such as web APIs or real-time chat applications. Node.js provides an event-driven model, non-blocking I/O, and a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries that make it easy to build scalable and performant applications. While MongoDB can be used with any programming language that has a driver available, Node.js is often used as the backend technology for web applications that use MongoDB as their database. Node.js provides a simple and efficient way to interact with MongoDB, allowing developers to easily read, write, and modify data in the database using JavaScript.

How is Node.js related to MongoDB ? 
Ans : Node.js and MongoDB can be used together to build scalable and performant web applications. Node.js provides a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript. It provides an event-driven model, non-blocking I/O, and a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries that make it easy to build scalable and performant applications. MongoDB, on the other hand, is a NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format. It is designed to work well with unstructured data and provides features such as automatic sharding and replication for high availability and scalability. One of the benefits of using Node.js with MongoDB is that both technologies use JavaScript. This means that developers can use the same language throughout their entire stack, from the frontend to the backend, which can simplify development and reduce the learning curve.Node.js also provides a simple and efficient way to interact with MongoDB using drivers such as Mongoose or the native MongoDB driver. These drivers provide a set of APIs that allow developers to easily read, write, and modify data in the database using JavaScript.Overall, Node.js and MongoDB are two complementary technologies that can be used together to build scalable, performant, and easy-to-maintain web applications.

Can we say that mongodb runs on node.js
Ans : No, MongoDB is not built on or run by Node.js. MongoDB is a standalone database management system that can be used with many programming languages, including JavaScript which is the language used by Node.js.Node.js can interact with MongoDB and provide an interface to it, but it does not run MongoDB. MongoDB runs as a separate process on its own server, regardless of what programming language is used to interact with it.However, Node.js can be used as a server-side technology for web applications that use MongoDB as their database. In this scenario, Node.js provides the application logic and interfaces with MongoDB to read and write data into the database. This allows developers to build end-to-end web applications using JavaScript.

can node.js handle multithreading ? 
Node.js is designed to be single-threaded, meaning it only uses one thread to process incoming requests and execute application code. However, Node.js does support asynchronous I/O operations, which allows it to handle multiple requests at the same time without blocking the event loop.  To take advantage of multiple CPU cores, Node.js provides a cluster module that allows developers to create a cluster of worker processes that can share the workload across multiple threads. Each worker process runs on a separate thread, which allows Node.js to take full advantage of multi-core systems.The cluster module works by creating child processes, each running an instance of the Node.js event loop, and sharing server sockets between them. When a new connection is received, the master process distributes it to one of the worker processes using a round-robin algorithm.It's important to note that while the cluster module allows Node.js to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, it does not provide true multithreading, as the worker processes are still single-threaded themselves. Instead, the cluster module creates multiple instances of the Node.js runtime environment, each with its own event loop and memory space.In summary, while Node.js itself is single-threaded, it provides the cluster module for developers to take advantage of multiple cores and distribute the workload across multiple worker processes.
