What is difference between MongoDB and Node.js ?   

Ans : MongoDB and Node.js are two different technologies that can be used together to build web applications, but they serve different purposes. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format. It is designed to work well with unstructured data and provides features such as automatic sharding and replication for high availability and scalability. Node.js, on the other hand, is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is often used for building server-side applications, such as web APIs or real-time chat applications. Node.js provides an event-driven model, non-blocking I/O, and a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries that make it easy to build scalable and performant applications. While MongoDB can be used with any programming language that has a driver available, Node.js is often used as the backend technology for web applications that use MongoDB as their database. Node.js provides a simple and efficient way to interact with MongoDB, allowing developers to easily read, write, and modify data in the database using JavaScript.

Q: What is Node.js and what is its use?   

Ans: Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build scalable and high-performance network applications.  

Node.js has several key features that make it popular and widely used:  

Asynchronous and Event-driven: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means it can handle multiple concurrent requests without getting blocked. This makes it highly efficient for handling large numbers of connections and performing I/O operations such as reading from or writing to databases, file systems, or network sockets.  

JavaScript Everywhere: With Node.js, developers can use the same programming language (JavaScript) for both front-end and back-end development. This enables code reuse, accelerates development speed, and promotes a unified development approach.  

Lightweight and Fast: Node.js has a minimalistic and lightweight design, making it fast and resource-efficient. Its ability to handle concurrent requests with a small memory footprint allows it to scale well, making it suitable for building real-time applications, APIs, microservices, and other network-intensive applications.  

NPM (Node Package Manager): Node.js comes bundled with npm, a powerful package manager that provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and frameworks. This extensive collection of modules allows developers to leverage existing solutions, easily integrate third-party libraries, and rapidly develop complex applications.  

Server-side Web Development: Node.js is commonly used for server-side web development, powering the backend of many popular websites and web applications. It offers frameworks like Express.js that provide a simple and flexible way to build web servers and APIs.

Microservices Architecture: Node.js works well in a microservices architecture, where applications are composed of small, independent services communicating with each other via lightweight protocols like REST or WebSocket. Its event-driven nature and scalability make it a suitable choice for building microservices-based systems.

Real-time Applications: Due to its event-driven nature and support for WebSockets, Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications like chat platforms, collaboration tools, multiplayer games, and streaming applications.

Overall, Node.js enables developers to build efficient, scalable, and high-performance applications using JavaScript across the entire technology stack. Its versatility and extensive ecosystem make it a popular choice for various types of projects.

Q: Explain the event loop in Javascript?   

Ans: The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that handles the execution of asynchronous code and ensures that JavaScript remains responsive to user interactions. It plays a crucial role in managing the flow of events, callbacks, and other asynchronous operations.

In JavaScript, code execution occurs within an environment known as the event loop, which consists of two main components: the call stack and the callback queue.

Call Stack: The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of currently running functions. Whenever a function is invoked, a new frame is added to the top of the call stack. The JavaScript engine executes functions in a synchronous manner, meaning it goes through the code line by line and completes each function before moving on to the next one.

Callback Queue: The callback queue is a queue that holds tasks or functions that are ready to be executed once the call stack becomes empty. These tasks typically include callbacks from asynchronous operations such as API requests, timer events, or user interactions.

Here's how the event loop works:

When the JavaScript engine encounters an asynchronous operation, such as making an API request or registering an event listener, it initiates the operation and continues executing the rest of the code without waiting for the result. This allows the program to remain responsive while the operation is being processed.

Once the asynchronous operation is completed, a corresponding callback function is placed in the callback queue.

If the call stack is empty, the event loop takes the first callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution. This causes the callback function to run and perform its designated task.

The JavaScript engine then resumes checking the call stack and the callback queue. If there are more callbacks in the queue, it repeats the process by pushing them onto the call stack one by one.

By continuously monitoring the call stack and callback queue, the event loop ensures that asynchronous tasks are executed in the correct order and at the appropriate time. It allows JavaScript to handle non-blocking I/O operations effectively and maintain a responsive user interface.

It's important to note that the event loop follows a "run-to-completion" model, which means that it completes the execution of one task before moving on to the next. This ensures that JavaScript maintains its single-threaded nature and prevents blocking or freezing of the main thread.

Q:Show use of event loop using timeout function   

Ans : 
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout callback");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

In this example, we have a setTimeout function that schedules a callback to be executed after a specified delay. Even though the delay is set to 0 milliseconds, the callback function is not immediately executed. Instead, it gets added to the callback queue, and the event loop will handle its execution when the call stack is empty.

Here's how the code execution unfolds:

The console.log("Start") statement is executed, printing "Start" to the console.

The setTimeout function is called with a callback function and a delay of 0 milliseconds. This schedules the callback for execution but doesn't block the execution flow.

The console.log("End") statement is executed, printing "End" to the console.

At this point, the call stack is empty. The event loop checks the callback queue and finds the callback function from the setTimeout.

The callback function is pushed onto the call stack.

The callback function is executed, printing "Inside setTimeout callback" to the console.

By scheduling the callback using setTimeout with a delay of 0 milliseconds, we ensure that it will be placed in the callback queue as soon as possible. However, as JavaScript follows the event loop mechanism, it won't execute the callback immediately; it waits for the call stack to be empty.

This example illustrates how the event loop manages asynchronous operations like the setTimeout function and ensures that they are executed at the appropriate time, even if the delay is set to 0 milliseconds.

How is Node.js related to MongoDB?   

Ans : Node.js and MongoDB can be used together to build scalable and performant web applications. Node.js provides a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript. It provides an event-driven model, non-blocking I/O, and a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries that make it easy to build scalable and performant applications. MongoDB, on the other hand, is a NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format. It is designed to work well with unstructured data and provides features such as automatic sharding and replication for high availability and scalability. One of the benefits of using Node.js with MongoDB is that both technologies use JavaScript. This means that developers can use the same language throughout their entire stack, from the frontend to the backend, which can simplify development and reduce the learning curve.Node.js also provides a simple and efficient way to interact with MongoDB using drivers such as Mongoose or the native MongoDB driver. These drivers provide a set of APIs that allow developers to easily read, write, and modify data in the database using JavaScript.Overall, Node.js and MongoDB are two complementary technologies that can be used together to build scalable, performant, and easy-to-maintain web applications.

Q : Can we say that mongodb runs on node.js ?

Ans : No, MongoDB is not built on or run by Node.js. MongoDB is a standalone database management system that can be used with many programming languages, including JavaScript which is the language used by Node.js.Node.js can interact with MongoDB and provide an interface to it, but it does not run MongoDB. MongoDB runs as a separate process on its own server, regardless of what programming language is used to interact with it.However, Node.js can be used as a server-side technology for web applications that use MongoDB as their database. In this scenario, Node.js provides the application logic and interfaces with MongoDB to read and write data into the database. This allows developers to build end-to-end web applications using JavaScript.

Q: Can node.js handle multithreading ?  

Ans : Node.js is designed to be single-threaded, meaning it only uses one thread to process incoming requests and execute application code. However, Node.js does support asynchronous I/O operations, which allows it to handle multiple requests at the same time without blocking the event loop.  To take advantage of multiple CPU cores, Node.js provides a cluster module that allows developers to create a cluster of worker processes that can share the workload across multiple threads. Each worker process runs on a separate thread, which allows Node.js to take full advantage of multi-core systems.The cluster module works by creating child processes, each running an instance of the Node.js event loop, and sharing server sockets between them. When a new connection is received, the master process distributes it to one of the worker processes using a round-robin algorithm.It's important to note that while the cluster module allows Node.js to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, it does not provide true multithreading, as the worker processes are still single-threaded themselves. Instead, the cluster module creates multiple instances of the Node.js runtime environment, each with its own event loop and memory space.In summary, while Node.js itself is single-threaded, it provides the cluster module for developers to take advantage of multiple cores and distribute the workload across multiple worker processes.

Q: What are some myths/confusions/misconceptions about JSON Web Tokens ?   

Ans : There are several myths and misconceptions about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Here are a few:

JWTs are encryption mechanisms: One of the most common misconceptions is that JWTs are used for encryption or data protection. However, this is not true. JWTs are primarily used for authentication and authorization purposes.

JWTs cannot be revoked: There is a belief that once a JWT is issued, it cannot be revoked. However, JWTs can be invalidated by maintaining a blacklist of revoked tokens on the server.

JWTs provide absolute security: While JWTs are secure and provide good protection against tampering, they are not foolproof. It is still possible for a determined attacker to intercept and decode JWTs if proper security measures are not taken.

JWTs are only useful for web applications: Although JWTs are commonly used in web applications, they can be used in any system that requires secure communication across multiple domains or systems.

JWTs contain sensitive information: While JWTs can carry information, including user data, they should not be used to transmit sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. These types of sensitive information should always be transmitted over HTTPS.

Q : What is the actual use of JSON Web tokens ?  

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular method for securely transmitting information between parties in the form of a digitally signed and encoded token. They are commonly used in web applications for authentication and authorization purposes.

When a user successfully logs into a web application, the server generates a JWT that contains some information about the user, such as their username or user ID. This JWT is then sent back to the client, where it is stored in local storage or a cookie.

In subsequent requests to the server, the client includes the JWT in the request headers. The server can then validate the JWT to confirm the user's identity and determine what actions they are authorized to perform.

JWTs offer several advantages over traditional session-based authentication methods. For one, they allow for stateless authentication, meaning that the server does not need to keep track of active sessions. Additionally, they can be easily shared across different services or domains, making them ideal for scaling distributed systems.

---

Q : What if I hijack a JWT from my friend's computer and then send the request using his's computer ?   

If you hijack a JWT from your friend's computer, you could potentially use it to impersonate your friend and access their account or perform actions on their behalf. This is known as a token theft attack.

However, there are several measures that can be taken to mitigate the risks of token theft attacks. Firstly, JWTs can be designed to have a short expiration time, so even if a token is stolen, it will automatically expire after a brief period of time. Additionally, JWTs can include information about the user's device or IP address, which can be used to detect suspicious activity and prevent unauthorized requests.

It's also important to note that JWTs are just one part of a larger authentication and authorization system, and should not be relied upon as the sole method of securing an application. Other security measures, such as password policies, multi-factor authentication, and rate limiting, 
should also be implemented to further protect against attacks.

Q : Why do we first upload our media files to our server and then from that server to the Media Server ?   

Why not do directly from the client to the media server? 

There are several reasons why it's generally not recommended to upload media files directly from the client to the media server:

Security: Uploading from the client to the media server requires opening up ports on the media server, which can increase its attack surface and make it more vulnerable to security threats such as hacking attempts.

Bandwidth: Depending on the size of the media file being uploaded, it can consume a significant amount of bandwidth, especially if multiple clients are uploading at the same time. This can slow down the media server and impact its performance.

Resource consumption: Media servers are often designed to handle large numbers of requests simultaneously and may be optimized for processing media files in specific formats or codecs. If clients were allowed to upload media files directly to the media server, it could potentially consume significant amounts of resources, leading to degraded performance for other users.

Scalability: By uploading media files to an intermediate server first, it allows for more efficient scaling of resources. The intermediate server can act as a buffer, allowing for better control over the flow of data and reducing the load on the media server.

Overall, while it might seem more convenient to upload media files directly from the client to the media server, there are several good reasons why it's generally recommended to use an intermediate server instead.

Q : What are RESTful APIs ?   

RESTful APIs are a type of web service that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to perform four basic operations:

Create (POST)
Read (GET)
Update (PUT/PATCH)
Delete (DELETE)
A RESTful API is designed to be stateless, meaning that each request contains all the necessary information to complete the request and no client context is stored on the server between requests. This allows for scalability and reliability in distributed systems.

In a RESTful API, resources are identified by their unique URL or endpoint, which can receive HTTP requests to execute the desired operation. The response usually comes in the form of JSON or XML data, providing the requested information or indicating the success or failure of the operation.

One of the benefits of using RESTful APIs is that they allow applications to communicate with each other independently of the programming languages or platforms used. This makes it easier to integrate different systems and create more flexible, modular architectures.

Q. What are pre and post middlewares in mongoose ?  

In Mongoose, middlewares are functions that can be executed before or after certain events occur on a model or a document.

Pre-middlewares are executed before an event occurs. For example, you might want to run some validation logic before saving a document to the database. To do this, you could define a pre-save middleware function that checks the data for errors and only allows the save operation to proceed if everything is valid.

Post-middlewares, on the other hand, are executed after an event has occurred. For example, you might want to perform some additional processing on a document after it has been saved to the database. To do this, you could define a post-save middleware function that runs after the save operation completes.

Both pre and post middlewares are defined using Mongoose's pre and post methods respectively. These methods take two arguments: the name of the event (e.g. 'save', 'validate', etc.) and the middleware function to execute.  

---

Q. In which form is the data stored in MongoDB ?   

In MongoDB, data is stored in a format called BSON (Binary JSON). BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents that can contain various types of data such as strings, integers, floating-point numbers, dates, arrays, and nested documents.

BSON is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to parse. It allows MongoDB to store and retrieve data quickly, even for large datasets. BSON also supports advanced features such as indexing, querying, and aggregation, which makes it useful for complex data operations.

One benefit of storing data in BSON format is that MongoDB uses a dynamic schema, meaning that each document can have its own unique set of fields. This allows for greater flexibility in the types of data that can be stored in MongoDB compared to traditional relational databases.

Overall, BSON provides a flexible and efficient way to store data in MongoDB, allowing for fast and scalable data storage and retrieval.
Both pre and post middlewares are defined using Mongoose's pre and post methods respectively. These methods take two arguments: the name of the event (e.g. 'save', 'validate', etc.) and the middleware function to execute.

Q: What is the use of "value" field here ? 
```javascript
<input
          required
          type="text"
          name="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={handleOnChange}
          placeholder="Enter email address"
          style={{
            boxShadow: "inset 0px -1px 0px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18)",
          }}
          className="w-full rounded-[0.5rem] bg-richblack-800 p-[12px] text-richblack-5"
        />
```
Ans : In the provided code snippet, the "value" field is used to bind the value of the input field to a corresponding variable in the code. In this case, the variable is likely named "email" and its value is being set as the current value of the input field.

By setting the "value" attribute to the "email" variable, any changes made by the user in the input field will automatically update the value of the "email" variable. This allows you to access and use the updated email value in your JavaScript code or framework.

For example, if the user enters "example@example.com" in the input field, the "email" variable will be updated with the corresponding value. You can then use this value for validation, submission, or any other operation related to the entered email address.  

Q : What will happen if I remove this value field?   
Ans : If you remove the "value" field from the code snippet, the input field will no longer be bound to a specific value in your code. As a result, the input field will not display any initial value and any changes made by the user will not be stored or updated in a variable.

Without the "value" field, the input field will become an uncontrolled component. This means that its value will only exist within the DOM and won't be accessible or controlled through your code. If you need to retrieve or manipulate the value entered by the user, you would have to rely on other means such as using JavaScript to read the value directly from the DOM.

In most cases, it is recommended to have the "value" field present and bind it to a corresponding variable so that you can easily access and manage the input field's value in your code.

Q: What is the use of e.preventDefault() function here ? 
```javascript
const signin = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const response = await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
    console.log(response)

  }
```
Ans : The e.preventDefault() function is used to prevent the default behavior of an event in JavaScript. In the provided code snippet, it is specifically used within the signin function as part of an event handler for a form submission.

When a form is submitted, the default behavior of the browser is to refresh the page or navigate to a new page. By calling e.preventDefault() within the event handler, you are instructing the browser to not perform its default action.

In this case, preventing the default behavior is important because the signin function likely performs an asynchronous operation using await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password). If the default behavior was not prevented and the page refreshed or navigated to a new page, the asynchronous operation may not complete properly or the result may be lost.

By calling e.preventDefault(), you ensure that the form submission does not trigger a page refresh or navigation, allowing the signin function to execute asynchronously and capturing the response from createUserWithEmailAndPassword. The captured response is then logged to the console using console.log(response) for further analysis or handling.
